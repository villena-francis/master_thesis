\chapter{Objetives}

The primary aim of this research is to evaluate cutting-edge long-read 
sequencing approaches to track and analyze somatic structural variations across 
cancer genomes evolution. To this end, we have established the following 
specific objectives:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Assess the technical feasibility of detecting large-scale structural 
    variants using synthetic long-read sequencing data that simulates current 
    ONT flow cell protocols.
    
    \item Evaluate and compare current SV callers, considering both their 
    detection accuracy and computational efficiency, to identify 
    optimal solutions for analysis workflows.
    
    \item Validate the possibility of detecting clinically relevant Multiple 
    Myeloma markers using long-read sequencing approaches, identifying both 
    their potential and current limitations for clinical applications.
    
\end{enumerate}
