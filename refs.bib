	abstract = {To a large extent, cancer conforms to evolutionary rules defined by the rates at which clones mutate, adapt and grow. Next-generation sequencing has provided a snapshot of the genetic landscape of most cancer types, and cancer genomics approaches are driving new insights into cancer evolutionary patterns in time and space. In contrast to species evolution, cancer is a particular case owing to the vast size of tumour cell populations, chromosomal instability and its potential for phenotypic plasticity. Nevertheless, an evolutionary framework is a powerful aid to understand cancer progression and therapy failure. Indeed, such a framework could be applied to predict individual tumour behaviour and support treatment strategies.},

In this Perspective, we take stock of the nascent field of genomic medicine. In what areas, if any, is genomics delivering on this promise, or is the path to success clear? Where are we falling short, and why? What have been the unanticipated developments? Overall, we argue that the optimism surrounding the transformational potential of genomics on medicine remains justified, albeit with a considerably different form and timescale than originally projected. We also argue that the field needs to pivot back to basics, as understanding the entirety of the genotype-to-phenotype equation is a likely prerequisite for delivering on the full potential of the human genome to advance the human condition.},

There are dozens of HGP-like projects which involve from a few tens to several million genomes currently in progress, which vary from having specialized goals or a more general approach. However, data generation, storage, management and analysis in public and private cloud computing platforms have raised concerns about privacy and security. The knowledge gained from further research has changed the field of genomics and is now slowly permeating into clinical medicine. The new precision (personalized) medicine, where genome sequencing and data analysis are essential components, allows tailored diagnosis and treatment according to the information from the patient’s own genome and specific environmental factors. P4 (predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory) medicine is introducing new concepts, challenges and opportunities. This review summarizes current sequencing technologies, concentrates on ongoing human genomics projects, and provides some examples in which precision medicine has already demonstrated clinical impact in diagnosis and/or treatment.},

However, most cancer patients do not yet benefit from cancer precision medicine. A central bottleneck is that most recurrently mutated genes in cancer are found mutated in fewer than 5\% of patients and most individual variants are found at exceedingly rare frequencies. As a result, how most of these individual variants function is currently unknown. Improving future clinical predictions requires overcoming this challenge. Here, we describe the current state of the emerging field of “precision functional genomics” which stands to complement existing approaches to improve the interpretation of cancer genomes.},

	abstract = {Cancer treatments have evolved from indiscriminate cytotoxic agents to selective genome- and immune-targeted drugs that have transformed the outcomes of some malignancies1. Tumor complexity and heterogeneity suggest that the ‘precision medicine’ paradigm of cancer therapy requires treatment to be personalized to the individual patient2–6. To date, precision oncology trials have been based on molecular matching with predetermined monotherapies7–14. Several of these trials have been hindered by very low matching rates, often in the 5–10\% range15, and low response rates. Low matching rates may be due to the use of limited gene panels, restrictive molecular matching algorithms, lack of drug availability, or the deterioration and death of end-stage patients before therapy can be implemented. We hypothesized that personalized treatment with combination therapies would improve outcomes in patients with refractory malignancies. As a first test of this concept, we implemented a cross-institutional prospective study (I-PREDICT, NCT02534675) that used tumor DNA sequencing and timely recommendations for individualized treatment with combination therapies. We found that administration of customized multidrug regimens was feasible, with 49\% of consented patients receiving personalized treatment. Targeting of a larger fraction of identified molecular alterations, yielding a higher ‘matching score’, was correlated with significantly improved disease control rates, as well as longer progression-free and overall survival rates, compared to targeting of fewer somatic alterations. Our findings suggest that the current clinical trial paradigm for precision oncology, which pairs one driver mutation with one drug, may be optimized by treating molecularly complex and heterogeneous cancers with combinations of customized agents.},

	abstract = {Nanopore sequencing, a third-generation sequencing technology, has revolutionized the gene sequencing industry with its advantages of long reads, fast speed, real-time sequencing and analysis, and potential in detecting base modifications. This technology allows researchers to sequence longer DNA fragments in a single read, providing more comprehensive genomic information compared to previous methods. Nanopore sequencing operates on electrical signals generated by a nanopore embedded in a membrane separating two electrolyte-filled chambers. When single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) passes through the nanopore, it creates variations in the current that correspond to different DNA bases. By analyzing these current fluctuations with machine learning algorithms, the DNA sequence can be determined. In this study, we introduced several improvements to nanopore sequencing, including nanopore local chemistry sequencing, novel motor and pore proteins, chip design, and basecalling algorithms. Our new nanopore sequencing platform, CycloneSEQ, demonstrated long-duration sequencing (107 hours) on a single chip with high yield ({\textgreater}50 Gb). In human genomic DNA sequencing, CycloneSEQ was able to produce long reads with N50 33.6 kb and modal identity 97.0\%. Preliminary findings on human whole-genome de novo assembly, variant calling, metagenomics sequencing, and single-cell RNA sequencing have further highlighted CycloneSEQ’s potential across different areas of genomics.},

Assemblies using massively parallel sequencing (MPS) have increased the diversity of draft genomes that are available but do not completely resolve genomes.When designing a de novo assembly project, the most-suitable assembly approach to use differs depending on the characteristics of the sequencing reads. MPS methods have relied on de Bruijn graphs, whereas single-molecule sequencing (SMS) reads require pairwise overlaps encoded in overlap or string graphs.A component of 'missing heritability' is missed sequence variation. Approximately 5–40 Mb of sequence are absent from any given human reference genome owing to structural polymorphism, and standard resequencing has missed detection of diseases such as medullary cystic kidney disease type 1, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.Single-molecule long-read sequencing is currently driving gains in genome assembly accuracy and completeness, but new technologies are being developed to generate long-range information, such as optical maps and dilution pool sequencing, that may aid in scaffolding complex regions.},

We applied our protocol to cell lines and brain tissue samples as part of a pilot project for the National Institutes of Health Center for Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias. Using a single PromethION flow cell, we can detect single nucleotide polymorphisms with F1-score comparable to Illumina short-read sequencing. Small indel calling remains difficult within homopolymers and tandem repeats, but achieves good concordance to Illumina indel calls elsewhere. Further, we can discover structural variants with F1-score on par with state-of-the-art de novo assembly methods. Our protocol phases small and structural variants at megabase scales and produces highly accurate, haplotype-specific methylation calls.},

By the combinatory use of short and long read sequencing data, we obtain long phased blocks of 834 kb in N50 length with {\textgreater}99\% concordance rate. By analyzing the obtained phasing information, we reveal that several cancer genomes harbor regions in which mutations are unevenly distributed to either of two haplotypes. Large-scale chromosomal rearrangement events, which resemble chromothripsis events but have smaller scales, occur on only one chromosome, and these events account for the observed biased distributions. Interestingly, the events are characteristic of EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinomas. Further integration of long read epigenomic and transcriptomic data reveal that haploid chromosomes are not always at equivalent transcriptomic/epigenomic conditions. Distinct chromosomal backgrounds are responsible for later cancerous aberrations in a haplotype-specific manner.},

	abstract = {Objective:
The aim of this project was to implement long-read sequencing for BCR-ABL1 TKI resistance mutation screening in a clinical setting for patients undergoing treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia.

Materials and Methods:
Processes were established for registering and transferring samples from the clinic to an academic sequencing facility for long-read sequencing. An automated analysis pipeline for detecting mutations was established, and an information system was implemented comprising features for data management, analysis and visualization. Clinical validation was performed by identifying BCR-ABL1 TKI resistance mutations by Sanger and long-read sequencing in parallel. The developed software is available as open source via GitHub at https://github.com/pharmbio/clamp

Results:
The information system enabled traceable transfer of samples from the clinic to the sequencing facility, robust and automated analysis of the long-read sequence data, and communication of results from sequence analysis in a reporting format that could be easily interpreted and acted upon by clinical experts. In a validation study, all 17 resistance mutations found by Sanger sequencing were also detected by long-read sequencing. An additional 16 mutations were found only by long-read sequencing, all of them with frequencies below the limit of detection for Sanger sequencing. The clonal distributions of co-existing mutations were automatically resolved through the long-read data analysis. After the implementation and validation, the clinical laboratory switched their routine protocol from using Sanger to long-read sequencing for this application.

Conclusions:
Long-read sequencing delivers results with higher sensitivity compared to Sanger sequencing and enables earlier detection of emerging TKI resistance mutations. The developed processes, analysis workflow, and software components lower barriers for adoption and could be extended to other applications.},

	abstract = {The combination of ultra-long Oxford Nanopore (ONT) sequencing reads with long, accurate PacBio HiFi reads has enabled the completion of a human genome and spurred similar efforts to complete the genomes of many other species. However, this approach for complete, “telomere-to-telomere” genome assembly relies on multiple sequencing platforms, limiting its accessibility.
ONT “Duplex” sequencing reads, where both strands of the DNA are read to improve quality, promise high per-base accuracy. To evaluate this new data type, we generated ONT Duplex data for three widely-studied genomes: human HG002, Solanum lycopersicum Heinz 1706 (tomato), and Zea mays B73 (maize). For the diploid, heterozygous HG002 genome, we also used “Pore-C’’ chromatin contact mapping to completely phase the haplotypes.
We found the accuracy of Duplex data to be similar to HiFi sequencing, but with read lengths tens of kilobases longer, and the Pore-C data to be compatible with existing diploid assembly algorithms. This combination of read length and accuracy enables the construction of a high-quality initial assembly, which can then be further resolved using the ultra-long reads, and finally phased into chromosome-scale haplotypes with Pore-C. The resulting assemblies have a base accuracy exceeding 99.999\% (Q50) and near-perfect continuity, with most chromosomes assembled as single contigs. We conclude that ONT sequencing is a viable alternative to HiFi sequencing for de novo genome assembly, and has the potential to provide a single-instrument solution for the reconstruction of complete genomes.},

Here we develop methods to group, classify and describe somatic structural variants, using data from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which aggregated whole-genome sequencing data from 2,658 cancers across 38 tumour types8. Sixteen signatures of structural variation emerged. Deletions have a multimodal size distribution, assort unevenly across tumour types and patients, are enriched in late-replicating regions and correlate with inversions. Tandem duplications also have a multimodal size distribution, but are enriched in early-replicating regions—as are unbalanced translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy-number gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent structure consists of 2–7 templates copied from distinct regions of the genome strung together within one locus. Such cycles of templated insertions correlate with tandem duplications, and—in liver cancer—frequently activate the telomerase gene TERT. A wide variety of rearrangement processes are active in cancer, which generate complex configurations of the genome upon which selection can act.},

TDPs with ∼11 kb TDs feature loss of TP53 and BRCA1. TDPs with ∼231 kb and ∼1.7 Mb TDs associate with CCNE1 pathway activation and CDK12 disruptions, respectively. We demonstrate that p53 and BRCA1 conjoint abrogation drives TDP induction by generating short-span TDP mammary tumors in genetically modified mice lacking them.

Due to the nature of available truth sets, our focus is on general-purpose rather than somatic callers. We characterise the impact on performance of event size and type, sequencing characteristics, and genomic context, and analyse the efficacy of ensemble calling and calibration of variant quality scores. Finally, we provide recommendations for both users and methods developers.},

	abstract = {A key goal of whole-genome sequencing for studies of human genetics is to interrogate all forms of variation, including single-nucleotide variants, small insertion or deletion (indel) variants and structural variants. However, tools and resources for the study of structural variants have lagged behind those for smaller variants. Here we used a scalable pipeline1 to map and characterize structural variants in 17,795 deeply sequenced human genomes. We publicly release site-frequency data to create the largest, to our knowledge, whole-genome-sequencing-based structural variant resource so far. On average, individuals carry 2.9 rare structural variants that alter coding regions; these variants affect the dosage or structure of 4.2 genes and account for 4.0–11.2\% of rare high-impact coding alleles. Using a computational model, we estimate that structural variants account for 17.2\% of rare alleles genome-wide, with predicted deleterious effects that are equivalent to loss-of-function coding alleles; approximately 90\% of such structural variants are noncoding deletions (mean 19.1 per genome). We report 158,991 ultra-rare structural variants and show that 2\% of individuals carry ultra-rare megabase-scale structural variants, nearly half of which are balanced or complex rearrangements. Finally, we infer the dosage sensitivity of genes and noncoding elements, and reveal trends that relate to element class and conservation. This work will help to guide the analysis and interpretation of structural variants in the era of whole-genome sequencing.},

We employed Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing in a paired diagnostic and post-therapy medulloblastoma to unravel the haplotype-resolved somatic genetic and epigenetic landscape. We assembled complex rearrangements, including a 1.55-Mbp chromothripsis event, and we uncover a complex SV pattern termed templated insertion (TI) thread, characterized by short (mostly {\textless}1 kb) insertions showing prevalent self-concatenation into highly amplified structures of up to 50 kbp in size. TI threads occur in 3\% of cancers, with a prevalence up to 74\% in liposarcoma, and frequent colocalization with chromothripsis. We also perform long-read-based methylome profiling and discover allele-specific methylation (ASM) effects, complex rearrangements exhibiting differential methylation, and differential promoter methylation in cancer-driver genes. Our study shows the advantage of long-read sequencing in the discovery and characterization of complex somatic rearrangements.},

	abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder with potential secondary organ effects including renal, bone, and bone marrow effects as well as neurologic and immune dysfunction. Diagnostic evaluation of MM includes laboratory and radiologic studies along with bone marrow biopsy to confirm diagnosis. Multiple myeloma is a clonal plasma cell malignancy that results from complex interactions between malignant progenitor cells, bone marrow stromal cells, and the bone marrow microenvironment. Multiple myeloma is clinically and pathologically heterogeneous, which results in variability in treatment response and survival. The disease trajectory varies for each patient, but relapses are inevitable and many patients become refractory to treatments. Management of relapsed and refractory (RR) MM requires careful evaluation of individual patient characteristics and the course of the disease. When determining treatment options for patients with RR MM, comorbidities, the frailty and vulnerability of the patient, and the specific adverse event profile associated with each treatment should be considered, as well as the patient's goals. The goal of therapy for patients with RR MM is to achieve disease control with acceptable toxicity and quality of life, which may be accomplished with novel agents, most likely in combination regimens. The integration of these novel agents into the treatment paradigm has shifted the perception of MM from incurable to a disease that may be considered chronic in the near future with a hope for long-term survival and maintained quality of life.},

	abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant neoplasm of terminally differentiated immunoglobulin-producing B lymphocytes called plasma cells. MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy, and it poses a heavy economic and social burden because it remains incurable and confers a profound disability to patients. Despite current progress in MM treatment, the disease invariably recurs, even after the transplantation of autologous hematopoietic stem cells (ASCT). Biological processes leading to a pathological myeloma clone and the mechanisms of further evolution of the disease are far from complete understanding. Genetically, MM is a complex disease that demonstrates a high level of heterogeneity. Myeloma genomes carry numerous genetic changes, including structural genome variations and chromosomal gains and losses, and these changes occur in combinations with point mutations affecting various cellular pathways, including genome maintenance. MM genome instability in its extreme is manifested in mutation kataegis and complex genomic rearrangements: chromothripsis, templated insertions, and chromoplexy. Chemotherapeutic agents used to treat MM add another level of complexity because many of them exacerbate genome instability. Genome abnormalities are driver events and deciphering their mechanisms will help understand the causes of MM and play a pivotal role in developing new therapies.},

The method is applicable to haploid, diploid or higher ploidy simulations for bulk or single-cell sequencing data. SVs are implanted into FASTA haplotypes at single-basepair resolution, optionally with nearby single-nucleotide variants. Short or long reads are drawn at random from these haplotypes using standard error profiles. Double- or single-stranded data can be simulated and VISOR supports the generation of haplotype-tagged BAM files. The tool further includes methods to interactively visualize simulated variants in single-stranded data. The versatility of VISOR is unmet by comparable tools and it lays the foundation to simulate haplotype-resolved cancer heterogeneity data in bulk or at single-cell resolution.VISOR is implemented in python 3.6, open-source and freely available at https://github.com/davidebolo1993/VISOR.

Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to process such data at scale, which presses for the development of new alignment algorithms.Minimap2 is a general-purpose alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of ≥100 bp in length, ≥1 kb genomic reads at error rate ∼15\%, full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads and assembly contigs or closely related full chromosomes of hundreds of megabases in length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions and introduces new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3–4 times as fast as mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and is ≥30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers at higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners specialized in one type of alignment.https://github.com/lh3/minimap2Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Accurate detection of somatic structural variants (SVs) and copy number aberrations (SCNAs) is critical to inform the diagnosis and treatment of human cancers. Here, we describe SAVANA, a computationally efficient algorithm designed for the joint analysis of somatic SVs, SCNAs, tumour purity and ploidy using long-read sequencing data. SAVANA relies on machine learning to distinguish true somatic SVs from artefacts and provide prediction errors for individual SVs. Using high-depth Illumina and nanopore whole-genome sequencing data for 99 human tumours and matched normal samples, we establish best practices for benchmarking SV detection algorithms across the entire genome in an unbiased and data-driven manner using simulated and sequencing replicates of tumour and matched normal samples. SAVANA shows significantly higher sensitivity, and 9- and 59-times higher specificity than the second and third-best performing algorithms, yielding orders of magnitude fewer false positives in comparison to existing long-read sequencing tools across various clonality levels, genomic regions, SV types and SV sizes. In addition, SAVANA harnesses long-range phasing information to detect somatic SVs and SCNAs at single-haplotype resolution. SVs reported by SAVANA are highly consistent with those detected using short-read sequencing, including complex events causing oncogene amplification and tumour suppressor gene inactivation. In summary, SAVANA enables the application of long-read sequencing to detect SVs and SCNAs reliably in clinical samples.},

	abstract = {Most current studies rely on short-read sequencing to detect somatic structural variation (SV) in cancer genomes. Long-read sequencing offers the advantage of better mappability and long-range phasing, which results in substantial improvements in germline SV detection. However, current long-read SV detection methods do not generalize well to the analysis of somatic SVs in tumor genomes with complex rearrangements, heterogeneity, and aneuploidy. Here, we present Severus: a method for the accurate detection of different types of somatic SVs using a phased breakpoint graph approach. To benchmark various short- and long-read SV detection methods, we sequenced five tumor/normal cell line pairs with Illumina, Nanopore, and PacBio sequencing platforms; on this benchmark Severus showed the highest F1 scores (harmonic mean of the precision and recall) as compared to long-read and short-read methods. We then applied Severus to three clinical cases of pediatric cancer, demonstrating concordance with known genetic findings as well as revealing clinically relevant cryptic rearrangements missed by standard genomic panels.},

Sniffles2 is 11.8 times faster and 29\% more accurate than state-of-the-art SV callers across different coverages (5–50×), sequencing technologies (ONT and HiFi) and SV types. Furthermore, Sniffles2 solves the problem of family-level to population-level SV calling to produce fully genotyped VCF files. Across 11 probands, we accurately identified causative SVs around MECP2, including highly complex alleles with three overlapping SVs. Sniffles2 also enables the detection of mosaic SVs in bulk long-read data. As a result, we identified multiple mosaic SVs in brain tissue from a patient with multiple system atrophy. The identified SV showed a remarkable diversity within the cingulate cortex, impacting both genes involved in neuron function and repetitive elements.},

However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner.Results: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.Availability and implementation: BEDTools was written in C++.

	abstract = {Multiple myeloma, which is located at multiple sites in the bone-marrow compartment, is a malignant plasma-cell tumour that is characterized by osteolytic bone lesions. It is a slowly proliferating tumour, typically with less than 1\% of tumour cells synthesizing DNA, until late in the disease, when multiple myeloma cells are often found outside the bone marrow. A pre-malignant lesion called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), which is present in 1\% of adults, progresses to malignant multiple myeloma at a rate of 1\% per year. The karyotypes of multiple myeloma are complex, and more similar to those found in epithelial tumours and the blast phase of chronic myelogenous leukaemia than to those in other haematopoietic tumours. Primary translocations — mediated by errors in B-cell-specific DNA modification processes — juxtapose one or more oncogenes and immunoglobulin transcriptional regulatory regions in ∼50\% of MGUS and multiple myelomas. In contrast to other B-cell malignancies, these translocations simultaneously dysregulate a variety of oncogenes, such as the genes for cyclin D1 or D3, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) combined with the nuclear protein MMSET, and the transcription factor c-MAF. Secondary translocations that do not involve B-cell-specific processes contribute to progression by dysregulating other oncogenes. Although c-MYC is dysregulated by primary translocations in some B-cell malignancies, it is dysregulated by secondary translocations, often without involvement of an immunogloublin locus, as myeloma tumours become more proliferative at a late stage of progression. Genetic changes are similar in pre-malignant MGUS and multiple myeloma, although the latter is distinguished by the presence of activating mutations of NRAS or KRAS2, and also a higher incidence of monosomy 13, indicating a possible tumour-suppressor gene on chromosome 13. Normal plasma cells, as well as MGUS and multiple myeloma cells, are dependent on the bone-marrow microenvironment for survival, growth and differentiation. These processes are, in part, mediated by paracrine interleukin-6 and insulin-like growth factor 1. The evolving interaction of multiple myeloma cells with the bone-marrow microenvironment is also involved in the secondary effects of malignancy, including osteolysis, anaemia and immunodeficiency. Multiple myeloma is an incurable malignancy for which the median survival has remained fixed at about 3 years for the past decade. Although MGUS can be efficiently diagnosed by a simple blood test, it is not possible to prevent progression or even predict when progression to myeloma will occur. Recent advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of these tumours indicate that improved approaches for prevention and treatment should be possible in the near future.},
