# Exploring Structural Variation in Tumor Evolution through Nanopore Sequencing 

Structural variants (SVs) are genomic alterations encompassing deletions, 
insertions, and segment rearrangements, ranging from kilobases to entire 
chromosomes. Despite their significance as biomarkers in oncological 
diseases, these variants have remained relatively unexplored compared to 
single nucleotide variants, largely due to the inherent limitations of 
short-read sequencing technologies that have dominated large-scale genome 
sequencing projects. This scenario has undergone a transformative change 
with the advent of long-read sequencing technologies, which have enabled 
the achievement of the first truly complete human telomere-to-telomere 
reference genome, successfully filling gaps that short reads could not 
resolve. This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive performance 
evaluation of long-read-based structural variant callers, specifically in 
the context of tumor evolution analysis. To address the limited availability
of appropriate datasets, we have developed specialized workflows leveraging 
high-performance computing resources for generating synthetic data with 
custom SVs, thus facilitating robust benchmarking of various structural 
variant detection methods. This computational approach enables systematic 
evaluation of SV detection algorithms under controlled conditions, 
providing valuable insights into their performance and reliability.
